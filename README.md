## GBL asset chain open source project
* GBL asset chain is a block chain intelligent sharing system, or a true block chain token wallet. The core concept of the GBL asset chain is to reorganize personal knowledge, skills, connections, resources, bad assets, and fixed assets with positive and negative assets. Rapid conversion into liquid assets by barter.
* GBL asset chain combines the NetEase planet mining mechanism, the multiple application advantages of the public trust, the imtoken cross-chain wallet function, and the import and creation of all Eterfon erc20 wallets. The system is simple to operate, the wallet has multiple security certifications, and the mining industry has low costs. advantage. The platform's unique token live, multi-platform token linked to the operation function, can quickly activate the market, saving a lot of operating costs.
* GBL trade system will be formally launched. All transactions, asset circulation will be de-centralized, point-to-point operations, the platform will not involve transaction funds,security and reliability, there will be no recommendation level relationship, and legal risks will be avoided. OTC transactions will only be realized as merchant payment point-to-point circulation. Eliminate member speculation and speculation, compliance and legal operation, GBL circulation assets as platform passes, community construction, industry node construction has contributors only donated not to sell, no policy risks, all point-to-point transactions to generate computing power, really do go to the center, go to the intermediary, True circulation creates value, so that individuals and businesses will save a lot of intermediary costs and create a lot of wealth in the world of block chains.
* Follow-up will also be online smart public chain, docking industry applications, asset circulation exchanges, games, commodity traceability, DAPP, block chain social networking, credit authorization and other real scene applications, personal knowledge, skills, and resources can be linked into assets, We should make it easy for resources to interact and share benefits.
* GBL asset chain, the Ethernet classic mining pool mechanism has been settled, and there will be more mainstream currency mining pools in the future. At that time, the GBL ecosystem, daily trading, sharing, and realization will all generate computing power. There are countless digital assets in the GBL asset chain.
